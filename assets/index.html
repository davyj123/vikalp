                    <p class="animate_bottom bottom-padding">Healthcare for children is one of the prime concerns of Vikalp. It focuses in imparting the knowledge of hygienic living to those who don’t have an access to basic healthcare. They could be slum- residents, labor families travelling across the country for work or even the poor of fixed geographic regions. Vikalp has actively interacted with Medical Officers of Shri Mata Vasihno Devi University and public infirmaries and launched its various initiatives as part of its endeavor to introduce healthcare awareness and contemporary healthcare to the underprivileged.
					The team has organized about 5 free camps since the inception of Vikalp. These were regular medical checkup camps, vaccination camps, and counseling and checkup camps. The camp provides them with free medicines, free consultations and counseling.

                    <h3 class="animate_top">Non-Formal Education and tuition classes</h3>
                    <p class="animate_bottom">Although there are many Government schools which children can attend, there is a big problem with non-attendance, low literacy and a high dropout rate for children from the lowest socio-economic groups. This is due to parental ignorance and fear. Therefore, there is a need to care for younger ones, without prejudice and discrimination. Vikalp has launched non-formal education programs in such a deprived locality of Jammu and Kashmir. The main aim of it is to provide free education to the children affected by poverty, migration, marginalization, natural calamity or child labor. Girls are even more likely to be uneducated as they often carry the burden of taking care of their siblings, domestic and paid work.
					The Vikalp team extends tuition program for children from around the Kakryal and Sira villages of Reasi District. These children do attend local schools but are deprived of holistic growth opportunities. They are also not aware of the benefits of Government schemes.  Vikalp endeavours to fill the gap as for as possible.

							<h3><i>"Vikalp..... An Alternative"</i></h3>
							
							<p class="animate_bottom">Despite India’s spectacular economic development, millions still have to go hungry; live in most unhygienic conditions, without even basic education for their children; and die of diseases that can be prevented. What is needed is to build a strong civil society that should work in tandem with the government in making a difference in the lives of those who are in need.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animate_bottom">
							The students at Shri Mata Vaishno Devi University initiated the Vikalp program in January 2009, with a small team of thoughtful and motivated students, whose main aim was to bring about an overall social change in the society. Today the program has reached a point where more and more people have chosen to become a part of this program. The program has become successful beyond everyone expectations and is best illustrated by the students as ‘an alternative, a step taken by the SMVDU family to provide education to the underprivileged children which has played the role of a candle in their dark lives’.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animate_bottom">
							The main objective of the Vikalp program is to extend basic education to the under-privileged children of the nearby villages and to the children of the of the construction workers on the campus. The objective is to take care of their overall growth including their medical care. Vikalp is committed to social justice, sustainable development and human rights and undertakes development activities and programs for the literacy of children, and adults who belong to poor and rural areas; provides occupational training and guidance for rehabilitation. The team at Vikalp is also planning to conduct surveys and social research work for the weaker sections.
                            </p>
                            <p class="animate_bottom">
							One of the major projects taken up by the team is to improve the condition of deprived living in poor human condition in suburbs of Kakryal and Sira villages, adjoining the University campus, in Reasi District of Jammu and Kashmir. The team conducts classes focusing on the issues of personal hygiene and general cleanliness for the students of the rural community in and around of the university premises. The focus is also on the healthcare and awareness program for various government initiatives.

					<h3> Prof. Sanjeev Jain</h3>
					<p>Vice Chancellor</p>
					<p class="vc-msg"> Education as a tool of change and as a source of positive energy is desirable for any society to progress in the right direction. Deprivation of such an opportunity is sinful and criminal lest the potential lost is irrecoverable. Efforts made by any educational institution of educating the needy and deprived as an additional responsibility contributes towards the noble cause of spreading knowledge and awareness. After all lighting a candle allows other candles to be lit and requires only a helping hand to spread light all around. 
					Vikalp has been an expression of social consciousness of high order amongst those who have chosen to illuminate the lives of the deprived in the neighbouring villages adjoining SMVDU. In the current phase of its initiative Vilakp has been able to make an imprint even if a small one. It would be desirable to maintain a record of its work meticulously and follow up those who benefitted from this effort. Showcasing of this noble cause would inspire others to replicate the model. Ascertaining quality improvement through feedback from its students would help the Coordinator and his team of faculty and students to provide value addition in the programme. It has been a wonderful experience to observe young associates of Vikalp from villages participating in several cultural functions of SMVDU. Their involvement in sports and cultural activities would help in their overall development. It is indeed a challenge to establish credibility and a meaningful role in shaping a holistic personality of currently underprivileged sections of the society around us. I wish the volunteer students, staff and faculty of SMVDU a bright future and the Vikalp a long and healthy life ahead.

					<p>Faculty Coordinator, Vikalp: A Students' Initiative</p>
					<p>Education is the elevation from the mundane to the divine. Pondering on this, I found a way out of the rat-race, I was running behind. Vikalp is a platform, which provides a voice to the unheard and works for human dignity at large.We want to ensure that those who are born with lesser means and thus considered underprivileged may not live that life too. In order to achieve this, we provide education and recreation to the poor and the needy. Our goal is to celebrate human and their lives in every form.</p>

Any institution or organization highly rests on the resources of the society, so one must develop in oneself a vision for society and a sense of paying back to society through service to society in some form or the other. That is why Vikalp is run on the basic principles of voluntary service and self-sustainability.”</p>
